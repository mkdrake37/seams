##Review
1. Big O analysis
2. Motivating example: Search techniques
  - Linear Search O(1) to O(n)
  - Binary Search O(1) to O(logn)
  - Quick Sort O(nlogn) to O(n^2)
  - Merge Sort O(nlogn)
  - Selection Sort O(n^2)
  - Insertion Sort O(n) to O(n^2)

##New Topics:

- Linear Algebra in Programming
- Having C interact with Python
- Parallelizing an algorithm



##Techniques I

 - Theoretically identifying "hotspots"
 - Empirically Identifying "hotspots"
 - optimizing whole process v. Code "chunks"

##Techniques II

 - estimation as optimization (what are your projects specific needs?)
 - probabilistic techniques (math examples, e.g. IsPrime())
 - Some deterministic optimization techniques (e.g. Numerical matrix methods, matlab Magic)
 - Language dependent optimization techniques, low versus high level languages
 - Hardware dependent techniques, using all your resources.
 - Parallel v. Serial

##Has optimization worked?

 - Empirical testing
 - If probabalistic methods used, is program correct for large enough class of inputs?

##Review Excercises
 - Exchange and optimize
 - independent small research projects/ presentations on commonly used algorithms

When to optimize (later), when not to optimize (initially).

How to theoretically identify hotspots - big-O analysis.

How to empirically determine out hotspots - performance testing.

Learning about the details of a language and how that's relevant to optimization.

When do you *need* to optimize?

When does optimization actually work?  E.g., parallel vs. serial approaches in
different settings / at different problem scales.

Optimization of whole inputs-into-results process vs. optimization of a code
chunk.
