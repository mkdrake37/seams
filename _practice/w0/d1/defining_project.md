title: How to Define a Programming Project

###Why do we write software?

Some scenarios:
- a script to extract some data from a file one time

- a data integration pipeline to merge information 
  from multiple sources

- analysis tools that do not exist (in my language/in
  a way that meets my needs)

- a graphical interface to communicate information to 
  non-technical users

- a smartphone game where people move pixels to make 
  the screen flash and this makes me rich

- an operating system


###Is there anything special about research software? Yes!
- Research software is often trying to do something new,
  and new endeavors don't always succeed.  It is more
  likely that you will have to stop and re-plan at some
  point in the middle of your project.

- A critical aspect of doing research is repeatability.
  Write your software in a way so that you and others
  will be able to re-create your results.  Sometimes you
  need to do this in order to sort out a bug; othertimes
  you want to repeat the analysis on a slightly different
  problem.

- Licensing for research software tends to be easy, because
  it is usually (and should be!) open source.  You can
  often use other open source software without problems,
  just remember to give appropriate credit to other
  software developers.


###Questions to answer (from class discussion):

1. What problem will it solve?
2. How beneficial will it be?
3. What kinds of methods?
4. Will it be efficient enough?
5. What programming language?
6. Is it sufficiently user-friendly?
7. Is it a correct algorithm / is it guaranteed to be 
   good enough?
8. Is it an improvement over existing methods?


###My list of questions to answer:

1. What is the problem to solve?
2. Who is the typical user?
3. Use case(s)?
4. Licensing?
5. Background research to do?
6. Data requirements?
7. Language/framework?
8. Hardware?
9. Operating system?
10. 3-5 milestones?
11. Potential challenges?


###Applying these ideas

For each of the following projects, take a few minutes to answer my list
of questions.

The projects:
1. command line tool that takes a URL and writes 
   plain text to disk

2. library that compares non-standard place names to
   a curated dictionary and does smart-matching

3. real-time prediction of match outcomes

4. battery tracker for smartphones that identifies 
   events that affect battery life (like software 
   updates, new apps, usage changes)

5. predictive elephant movement simulator
