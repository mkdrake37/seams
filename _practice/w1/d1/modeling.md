## GameBot

Each team (of two) will create a Keeper and Kicker Bot, and each team will play every other team in a game once.  In the game, Team A's Kicker plays Team B's Keeper 10,000 times (resulting in a score A1-B1), and Team B's Kicker plays Team A's Keeper 10,000 times (resulting in a score A2-B2).  The winner of this game will be the greater score (A1+A2 or B1+B2), with a tie possible.  The winner of the tournament will have the best record W-L-T (where wins are worth 3 and ties 1 each).  

Dictate a strategy for your Goalie and Kicker.  Each can "learn" from the opponent during the game (remembers the history up the the 10,000th kick), but enters each new game against a new opponent unaware of the opponent's history.

1. As the Goalie you can move to deflect L/C/R.
2. As the Kicker, you can shoot (kick the ball) L/C/R.

| Ki/Ke |  L  |  C  |  R  |
|------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|     L | 0.1 | 0.6 | 0.9 |
|     C | 0.7 | 0.2 | 0.7 |
|     R | 0.9 | 0.8 | 0.1 |

Each team should submit code containing a NewKicker and a NewKeeper which inherit from Kicker and Keeper respectively.  Name your file with your team name.
