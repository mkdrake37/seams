title: How to Define a Programming Project in Research
---

1. Think about the following general questions
   * Why are you interested in this topic?  Why is this topic important?  
   * What question do you plan to answer?  Do you have a hypothesis yet?
   * What information/data do you need? How will you obtain it?
   * What subproblems do you anticipate (again consider part:whole, history, use)
   * How will you draw conclusions from that information? (What coding will you need to do?  What software will you use?)
   * What will your results be used for?
2. Outline/draw an overview of your research problem plan.
3. Conduct an initial review of literature and more precisely define your research problem.  Again, what subproblems do you foresee arising?
3. Identify Literature for Further Review
   * Summarize the results of previous research to form a foundation on which to build your own research
   * Collect ideas on how to gather data
   * Investigate methods of data analysis

*Students who have completed some research already should be honest about how they would do their project differently with aftersight.  He is expected to create a new proposal based on his research and open to feedback and constructive criticism.*

*No coding.* Initial work should be handwritten, then typed up (plaintext) as (at most) a draft outline for some sort of publication.  Students will present their research proposals at the end of the day.
